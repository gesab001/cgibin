Clark has not been working since The Copenhagen House had to close due to the coronavirus pandemic. Solvang is a tiny town of 5,300 people nestled in the Santa Ynez Valley wine country, about a half-hour north of Santa Barbara. Tourists - mainly those who make the short drive from Los Angeles and Orange counties -- are the engine of an economy than generates nearly $200 million in economic activity a year. And without it hundreds in Solvang and the surrounding bedroom communities have lost their jobs while the city is losing $500,000 in tax revenue a month.

County Department of Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer addresses a press conference held at the steps of Kenneth Hahn Hall of Administration to declare a health emergency as the number of coronavirus cases increased to seven, with six new cases in Los Angeles County. None of the new cases are connected to "community spread," officials said. All individuals were exposed to COVID-19 through close contacts. The additional cases were confirmed Tuesday night. Officials said three of the new cases were travelers who had visited northern Italy, two were family members who had close contact with someone outside of the county who was infected, and one had a job that put them in contact with travelers. One person has been hospitalized, and the others are isolated at home. (Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times)]]></media:description>

He moved from Los Angele to Red Bluff, California in 1972, where he rides around town in an electric wheelchair after suffering a second accident later in life. There are no medical marijuana dispensaries within miles, but Phillips has no problem finding pot. "There ain't no dispensaries in this town," said Phillips, "This is one poor town." He worries that there are sick people in his apartment building, but so far there has only been one case of Covid-19 in Red Bluff, CA. (Carolyn Cole / Los Angeles Times)]]></media:description>
